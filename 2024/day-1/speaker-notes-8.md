 * I know **Jürg** from **studying** together at **OST** (then **HSR**), where
   we studied **electronic engineering**.
 * He works for **Hamilton Bonaduz**, a **hardware company** specialiced in
   **lab automation**.
 * There they use Python for laboratory and research projects so we are curious
   the learn about that!

## Abstract

In a brief review of the history of Python at Hamilton, we learn the different uses of Python and the great libraries that are available to simplify the life of an engineer. From device drivers and abstraction of complex processes to data acquisition, analysis and visualization, Python provides a one-stop shop to help developers get to their goals quickly. With an outlook, we show how laboratory specialists and researchers will be able to build on a solid ground in the future.
