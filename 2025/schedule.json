We‚Äôll explore some essential bits from `itertools`, `functools`, and `operator` modules, aiming to write more expressive, debuggable code.\r\n\r\nStarting with pure functions and lazy evaluation, we'll build up to solving real AoC problems using techniques like:\r\n\r\n- `itertools.pairwise()` for sequence comparisons\r\n- `functools.reduce()` for data aggregation  \r\n- `operator.itemgetter()` for elegant sorting\r\n- Generator expressions for memory-efficient processing\r\n\r\nThrough some puzzles from various years, we‚Äôll see how functional approaches often lead to more concise solutions that closely mirror the problem description. We'll compare imperative vs functional solutions, highlighting pros and cons of both approaches.\r\n\r\nWhether you're preparing for coding interviews, tackling AoC, or just want to expand your Python toolkit, you'll leave with a couple more ideas for writing cleaner, more Pythonic code‚Äîno external dependencies required.",

Drawing from real-world civic and infrastructure projects scenarios in Nigeria, I‚Äôll walk through techniques to queue, cache, and sync data locally, using tools like SQLite, Redis, Celery, and FastAPI. We‚Äôll explore design patterns that prevent data loss, improve user experience, and simplify reconciliation once connectivity is restored.\r\n\r\nWhether you‚Äôre building field data tools, mobile dashboards, or lightweight IoT integrations, this session will equip you with the mindset and technical building blocks to ensure your Python applications stay resilient ‚Äî no matter the network conditions.",

                "abstract": "Over the years, the lack of an array data type in Python has resulted in the creation of numerous array libraries, each specializing in unique niches but still having some interoperability between each other. NumPy has become the de facto array library of Python, and the other array libraries try to keep their API close to that of NumPy. However, this often becomes infeasible, and the libraries deviate out of necessity. To make Python's array libraries shake hands with each other without any inconsistencies, the Consortium for Python Data API Standards has formalised an Array API standard for libraries offering array creation and manipulation operations.\r\n\r\nThe Array API standard allows users to write and use the same code for arrays belonging to any of the standard-conforming libraries. Through this talk, we will explore the need for such standardisation and discuss its salient features in detail. We will primarily delve into the example of using this standard to make specific parts of European Space Agency's Euclid space mission's code GPU and autodiff compatible. Besides cosmology, we will also take a look at a few other examples, mostly sourced from my experience working with and on several Python array libraries for scientific computing. Ultimately, the audience can expect to leave the room with the knowledge of both, the software engineering and the research side of the array API standard.",

Today, the process is slow and cumbersome for everyone involved: it requires studying lengthy PDFs, writing formal letters, and even synthesising legal arguments by copy-pasting into Excel. There‚Äôs a huge opportunity to streamline this process and make this democratic tool more accessible and inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I‚Äôll share how we‚Äôre tackling this challenge with machine learning: building data processing pipelines, extracting features from endless PDFs, embedding and classifying text, designing and evaluating models‚Äîand ultimately deploying them in production. Because the data comes from the federal administration and 26 different cantons, it‚Äôs often heterogeneous and in varying formats. Data quality, in general, presents many challenges for both training and evaluation. Spoiler: PDF is a pretty terrible format for machines‚Ä¶ \r\n\r\nOur approach is practical and pragmatic, and our code is open source, so you‚Äôre welcome to explore our solutions or even contribute yourself!",

Docling provides a unified and expressive DoclingDocument format, enabling easy export to Markdown, HTML, and lossless JSON. It offers plug-and-play integrations with popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Crew AI, and Haystack, along with strong local execution support for sensitive data and air-gapped environments. As a Python package, Docling is pip-installable and comes with a clean, intuitive API for both programmatic and CLI-based workflows, making it easy to embed into any data pipeline or AI stack. Its modular design also supports extension and customization for enterprise use cases.\r\n\r\nWe also introduce SmolDocling, an ultra-compact 256M parameter vision-language model for end-to-end document conversion. SmolDocling generates a novel markup format called DocTags that captures the full content, structure, and spatial layout of a page, and offers accurate reproduction of document features such as tables, equations, charts, and code across a wide variety of formats ‚Äî all while matching the performance of models up to 27√ó larger.",

We will go over the various approaches for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify sensitive entities and the use of diffusion models to inpaint anonymized content.",

Each agent has a specialized role‚Äîretrieving context, generating tests, and analyzing results‚Äîworking together as a self-learning testing team.\r\n\r\nThe session will include a live walkthrough of a Python-based pipeline using PyTest, Selenium, LangChain, and ML models to:\r\n‚Ä¢ Automate UI and regression testing with minimal manual intervention\r\n‚Ä¢ Generate intelligent, context-aware test cases from code and API specs\r\n‚Ä¢ Use anomaly detection to flag subtle bugs based on test logs\r\n‚Ä¢ Continuously evolve test logic as the app evolves\r\n\r\nBy leveraging AI agents, teams can reduce manual QA efforts, improve test coverage, and increase reliability across fast-moving software projects.

Drawing from examples such as trade networks, corporate structures, and historical data, I will demonstrate how network analysis reveals insights that would otherwise remain hidden. Using NetworKit (and NetworkX), we will analyze real-world datasets to answer questions like:\r\n\r\n1. What does the core-periphery model reveal about trade networks?\r\n2. Could we have predicted that Moscow will become Russia's capital?\r\n3. How do corporate hierarchies differ from interaction hierarchies within organizations?\r\n\r\nThroughout the talk, I will introduce key concepts in network analysis and showcase Python as a tool for research. Attendees will have access to all datasets and code, enabling them to replicate the analyses and apply these techniques to their own projects.
