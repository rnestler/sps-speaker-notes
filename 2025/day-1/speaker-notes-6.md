# Emeka Onyebuchi — Building Resilient Python Apps for Unreliable Networks

14:00 - 14:30

\newpage

## Biography

Emeka Onyebuchi is a Python backend and AI engineer with years of experience building high-impact systems for companies across the fintech, civic tech, and energy sectors. He has led the development of scalable APIs, data platforms, and infrastructure for projects ranging from payment gateways to smart grid applications, often working in challenging environments where network reliability cannot be taken for granted.

## Abstract

In many parts of the world, especially across Africa, software cannot assume a stable internet connection. From rural communities to field agents working in transit or enforcement, the reality is simple: offline is the default, and sync is a luxury.

In this talk, we’ll explore how to build offline-first applications using Python — apps that work gracefully when the network doesn’t. Drawing from real-world civic and infrastructure projects scenarios in Nigeria, I’ll walk through techniques to queue, cache, and sync data locally, using tools like SQLite, Redis, Celery, and FastAPI. We’ll explore design patterns that prevent data loss, improve user experience, and simplify reconciliation once connectivity is restored.

Whether you’re building field data tools, mobile dashboards, or lightweight IoT integrations, this session will equip you with the mindset and technical building blocks to ensure your Python applications stay resilient — no matter the network conditions.
