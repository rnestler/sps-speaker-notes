## Abstract

Code review is a central part of everyday developer jobs. The motivation to create this talk was a quote:
“The most important superpower of a developer is complaining about everybody else's code.” In this talk, I’ll explain my approach to better code review.

Sometimes, it’s hard to convince a colleague about change or don’t change some lines of code. In my talk I would like to cover some best practices from my software engineering experience about efficient and honest code review. How to create a culture of perfect code review. How to apply automatic tools to improve code review routine of repetitive comments or suggestions. How to write/or reuse coding style guides for your team to reduce the time spent arguing about naming conventions and different styles.
What needs to be automated and what needs to be not automated during code review? The key role of patterns that can be reusable is not to confuse colleagues.
