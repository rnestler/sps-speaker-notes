# Ines Panker — Software estimation: False sense of certainty

15:15 - 15:45

 * Working at a Software Agency I know alot about the difficulties of
   estimating tasks and thus look forward to learn how to improve in that
   regard!

## Biography

I've been building software for almost 2 decades. 
I'm fascinated by elegant solutions to complex problems, finding simple, straightforward patterns in what at first glance appears to be unorganized chaos. 
And I love to observe the human aspect of software. People, human interactions and motivations are just as much integral to software development as the focus on solid architecture that is maintainable, scalable and efficient.

## Abstract

It has been known since the 70s that developers tend to give very optimistic estimations. 

We prefer to have exact numbers, even if that means they are wrong most of the time. 

In research, developers admitted that they believe their managers will see them as less competent if they provide estimates with huge margins. But mathematically speaking providing a wider min-max interval means you will be right more often.

Sp, maybe it isn’t really accuracy that businesses and people are looking for. Maybe estimates are needed for the sole purpose of risk aversion. 

Risk can be measured in other ways.

Maybe it is time we stop estimating tasks left and right and instead start managing the project’s risk and customer’s expectations.
