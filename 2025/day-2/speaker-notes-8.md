# Kshitijaa Jaglan â€” What Networks tell us about Trades, Power, and the World?

15:50 - 16:20

 * Kshitijaa likes to use **AI**, **machine learning** and **networks** to
   **optimze complex systems** and make them faster and easier to understand.
 * His talk will introduce us to several methods to **analyze** real-world
   problems by using **graph-based method** and **network analysis**.
 * In an ever more connected and networked world this will for sure come in
   handy.

## Biography

I'm Kshitijaa Jaglan, and I like using AI, Machine Learning and Networks to make complex systems (and the web) a little more optimized, fast and understandable! Currently I am transitioning from my research position at the Social Computing Group, University of Zurich, towards more applied and technical roles in industry.

## Abstract

Networks are all around us, shaping phenomena like epidemics, communication, and transportation. In this talk, we will explore how real-world problems can be analyzed and solved using graph-based methods and simple algorithms. Drawing from examples such as trade networks, corporate structures, and historical data, I will demonstrate how network analysis reveals insights that would otherwise remain hidden. Using NetworKit (and NetworkX), we will analyze real-world datasets to answer questions like:

1. What does the core-periphery model reveal about trade networks?
2. Could we have predicted that Moscow will become Russia's capital?
3. How do corporate hierarchies differ from interaction hierarchies within organizations?

Throughout the talk, I will introduce key concepts in network analysis and showcase Python as a tool for research. Attendees will have access to all datasets and code, enabling them to replicate the analyses and apply these techniques to their own projects. This session is designed for Python enthusiasts with an interest in data science, networks, and/or applied research.
