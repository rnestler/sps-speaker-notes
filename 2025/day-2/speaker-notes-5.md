# Jyoti Yadav — Agentic Cyber Defense with External Threat Intelligence

13:30 - 14:00

 * Jyoti is a Cyber Security Data Scientist at Microsoft.
 * He has experience in data science, machine learning and quite obviously
   cyber security.
 * Her previous work includes building models for fraud detection, market
   forecasting and security risk assessments.
 * In her talk she will explain how one can use agentic AI systems for
   proactive cybersecurity.

## Biography

## Abstract

This talk will detail how to integrate external threat intelligence data into an autonomous agentic AI system for proactive cybersecurity. Using real world datasets—including open-source threat feeds, security logs, or OSINT—you will learn how to build a data ingestion pipeline, train models with Python, and deploy agents that autonomously detect and mitigate cyber threats. This case study will provide practical insights into data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the challenges of adversarial conditions.
