# Sneha Mavuri and Koti Vellanki — AI-Powered Software Testing with Multi-Agent Systems

15:15 - 15:45

 * Sneha is a software engineer and QA specialist.
 * Her focus is on ensuring that web, mobile and backend systems work
   seamlessly and reliably, using tools like Playwright, Appium, WebdriverIO
   and Postman.
 * In the next 30 minutes we will explore how we can dynamically generate test
   cases using ML models.

## Biography

Sneha is a software engineer and QA specialist with 3 years of experience, currently working at Swiggy. She focuses on ensuring that web, mobile, and backend systems work seamlessly and reliably. She uses tools like Playwright, Appium, WebdriverIO, and Postman to find bugs early and deliver smooth user experiences at scale.

Previously, she worked at CloudDefense.AI, Morgan Stanley, and Wingify, where she built a strong foundation in cloud security, software development, and testing.

## Abstract

Traditional software testing struggles to keep pace with rapidly evolving applications—resulting in brittle test cases, time-consuming maintenance, and poor bug detection. This session introduces a smarter, adaptive approach using AI-powered Multi-Agent Systems that automate and continuously improve testing workflows.

We’ll explore how Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) transforms testing by dynamically generating test cases, adjusting to app changes in real-time, and detecting bugs with greater accuracy. Each agent has a specialized role—retrieving context, generating tests, and analyzing results—working together as a self-learning testing team.

The session will include a live walkthrough of a Python-based pipeline using PyTest, Selenium, LangChain, and ML models to:
• Automate UI and regression testing with minimal manual intervention
• Generate intelligent, context-aware test cases from code and API specs
• Use anomaly detection to flag subtle bugs based on test logs
• Continuously evolve test logic as the app evolves

By leveraging AI agents, teams can reduce manual QA efforts, improve test coverage, and increase reliability across fast-moving software projects. Whether you're a QA engineer, developer, or test automation architect, this talk will give you practical tools and ideas to build scalable, AI-driven QA systems using Python.
