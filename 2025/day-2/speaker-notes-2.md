# Alex Shershebnev — AI Coding Agents and how to code them

09:45 - 10:15

 * As a seasoned **Computer Vision** and **MLOps Engineer**, Alex leads the
   ML/DevOps team at Zencoder. His team delivers **machine learning
   solutions**, including **data pipelines**, **cloud infrastructure** and, of
   course, **ML pipelines**.
 * Who has used **AI IDEs** for developing code like **Curser**, **Windsurf**
   or similar?
 * He will talk about **AI agents** and what they bring on the table for the
   coding world! I'm looking forward on ways to improve my usage of such tools
   and get a glimps into how the coding future may look like.

## Biography

Alex Shershebnev is a seasoned Computer Vision and MLOps Engineer with over ten years of experience shaping the future of AI-driven software development. Currently, Alex leads the ML/DevOps team at Zencoder, where he leverages his extensive background in Software Engineering, ML and DevOps to deliver high-quality machine learning solutions. His work spans complex data pipelines, cloud infrastructure management (GCP, Kubernetes), and advanced ML/DevOps pipelines.

## Abstract

AI Agents are the next big thing everyone has been talking about. They are expected to revolutionize various industries by automating routine tasks, mission critical business workflows, enhancing productivity, and enabling humans to focus on creative and strategic work. Of course, you can apply them to your everyday coding tasks as well.

In this talk we’ll go over what those agents can bring to the table of coding world, and why they can deliver the promise of coding smarter that the current generation of coding assistants can’t. We will then dive right into a quick live coding session where I’ll show what such agents can do in real life and how you can start using them to enhance your everyday life already right after the talk. And we’ll finish off with some remarks on what the future of programming might look like in the near future as those agents get included into your everyday life.
