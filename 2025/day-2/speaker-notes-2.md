## Abstract

AI Agents are the next big thing everyone has been talking about. They are expected to revolutionize various industries by automating routine tasks, mission critical business workflows, enhancing productivity, and enabling humans to focus on creative and strategic work. Of course, you can apply them to your everyday coding tasks as well.

In this talk we’ll go over what those agents can bring to the table of coding world, and why they can deliver the promise of coding smarter that the current generation of coding assistants can’t. We will then dive right into a quick live coding session where I’ll show what such agents can do in real life and how you can start using them to enhance your everyday life already right after the talk. And we’ll finish off with some remarks on what the future of programming might look like in the near future as those agents get included into your everyday life.
