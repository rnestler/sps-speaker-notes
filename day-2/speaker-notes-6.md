## Biography

Hey all

I'm a Data Scientist at celebrate company by day and an AI storyteller by night.

After experiences in research at Fraunhofer Fokus Institute and tinkering with sensor setups for autonomous vehicles, I decided to get more hands-on and joined celebrate company, where I'm now helping our customers to design amazing products with the help of Machine Learning.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on cognitive systems from TU Berlin.

## Abstract

Join us on two Vision-Language Adventures! 

We'll uncover the information hidden inside big image collections with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) showing us the way. Who knows which forgotten gems await us?

In the first part, we'll use CLIP and FAISS to go on a treasure hunt in your photo collection. You'll learn how to filter through millions of images in a breeze, using natural language. Bye-bye endless scrolling, hour-long tagging, and frustrated folder searching

In the second part, we will harness the power of VLMs to help us caption images - translating pixels to words. Then we'll apply simple NLP methods like Bag-of-Words and clustering to reveal deep insights into your photo collections.

By the end of this talk, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to unlock new insights, identify patterns, and make your image data work harder for you.

This talk is for an intermediate audience - it is good if you bring some knowledge in Computer Vision, NLP or just general Deep Learning.

The talk will be structured as follows: 
- 5min - What are VLMs? 
- 10min - Image Search with CLIP and FAISS 
- 10min - Analysis of Captioned Images 
-  5min - Possible Applications, Closing Thoughts
