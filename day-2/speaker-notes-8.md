# Isaac Chung â€” Prototype to Production for RAG applications

15:40 - 16:10

 * Staff Data Scientiest at Wrike, enabling new generative AI features in
   production.
 * He also helps maintaining MTEB and organizes PyData in Tallinn.
 * He will introduce us to hallucinatioon issues from LLMs which may come in
   handy right before the apero.

## Biography

I am currently a Staff Data Scientist at Wrike, where I work on enabling new generative AI features in production. I also help maintain MTEB and organize PyData Tallinn in my spare time. My background is in Aerospace Engineering and Machine Learning and I hold undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Toronto.

## Abstract

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been used to mitigate hallucination issues from LLMs and rapidly provide LLMs with external knowledge that were not part of the pre-training data. While tutorials offer convenient ways to build POCs quickly, transitioning these prototypes to production environments often catches us off-guard with unforeseen challenges. This talk takes a deeper dive into the topics that are often missing from cookbooks and tutorials yet are crucial in scaling your RAG prototype to production. Our discussion will use real examples to help you better understand some of the best practices in production RAG for observability, security, scalability, and fault tolerance.
