# Luca Gubler â€” Automate your network in 5 easy steps with Python and Netmiko

## Abstract

Network automation is important for efficient and reliable network management. In simple terms it means using software to automate tasks like configuring or testing network devices like routers or switches. This increases the speed of deploying new configurations while reducing human error - a win-win situation for everyone!

This talk introduces Netmiko, a powerful yet simple Python library for network automation. Netmiko provides an easy-to-use interface for SSH-based interactions with network devices. The syntax of Netmiko is easy to understand and it's vendor agnostic approach let's you automate all kinds of network devices.

I'll show you how Netmiko works, starting with building your inventory of devices and connecting to them. Then we'll move on to sending config commands and configuring the devices. Finally, we'll verify if the config was applied successfully.

By the end of this talk, you will be able to use Netmiko to automate your own network devices!

## Biography

Hi, I'm Luca, a systems engineer at onway. A lot of my job revolves around automating things. I work on everything from our mobile routers, which we use to operate complete vehicle fleets in the public transport sector, to our own internal infrastructure.

I love network automation. It's pretty amazing if you can set up a complete network across multiple different systems with the click of a button. Not many people know about network automation, so I'd like to show you more about it.
