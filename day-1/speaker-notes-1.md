# Chantal Keller — Empowering Independence: Robot-Assisted Shopping for the Visually Impaired with Product Recognition

 * **Studied electrical engineering** focused on project with a **societal
   impact** where she used Python.
 * Motivated by the **potential of technology** to improve lives
 * I'm exited to her how Chantal improved shopping for **visually impaired** people

## Biography

Throughout my studies in electrical engineering, I focused on projects with a societal impact, especially in the medical field, where I often used Python for development. After completing my master’s degree this year, I now work at the Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences, where I am eager to embrace new challenges that drive social change. Motivated by the potential of technology to improve lives, I am always excited to collaborate on projects that combine innovation with purpose.

## Abstract

Shopping independently presents significant challenges for the visually impaired. I address these obstacles with a Python-based shopping assistance system that combines product and hand detection with speech recognition.

In this talk, we’ll explore how computer vision technology, leveraging a camera and pre-trained models, enables visually impaired users to navigate supermarkets and select products autonomously. By recognizing items and providing acoustic guidance for hand positioning, a self-driving system empowers users to shop without external help. Additionally, attendees will learn how voice commands, processed through speech recognition, create a user-friendly interface.
